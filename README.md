## Naughts-Crosses-Connect-4
Console application to play Naughts & Crosses or Connect 4 on varying grid sizes

Can save/load the game using binary files

Uses mini-max with alpha-beta pruning

Use arrow keys & enter to navigate the menu



### It was originally made as my A-Level project so:

It uses classes when they're not necessary as that got higher marks

The comments aren't in regular positions and are just slotted in there

Lots of "If condition = True Then" instead of just "If condition Then"

Lines go way over 80 characters


I learnt a lot from this project but didn't learn what a code style is and how to write legible code
